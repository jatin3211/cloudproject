Title of project:  Data Security Using Cloud Split
Name of Project Guide:  Mrs Vimmi Malhotra

ABSTRACT
 Every company is transferring its data to the cloud, means it uses the storage service provided by the cloud provider. So it is mandatory to protect that data against hackers. In this reference we propose splitting algorithms on data as well as for increasing the security we provide steganography, compression and encryption of data at a single platform with user login facility adoptable to better cloud security. We focus on the problem of data security in cloud data storage and data transmission, which is essentially a distributed storage system. 
In data transmission, data which we are trying to share, will we first splitted in n parts by the user, after splitting of files user will choose to encrypt the file using AES encryption of each part, after encryption technique, Each part has to be compressed by the user, Compression technique is proposed because of file size reduction. The basic plan is to use many clouds at constant time to mitigate the risks of malicious knowledge manipulation, disclosure, and method meddling. This design changed targets the confidentiality of knowledge and process logic. The idea of this design is that the applying logic must be divided into fine-grained components and these components area unit distributed to distinct cloud. In coding technique, the user encrypts the information together with his public key and uploads the cipher texts to the Cloud. The cloud will severally figure on the encrypted knowledge to get AN encrypted result that solely the user will decode. The user (or a little trusty non-public cloud) manages the keys and performs the coding and coding operations, whereas the huge computation on encrypted knowledge is finished by an untrustworthy public cloud.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	The data over cloud is completely under the untrustworthy CSP (cloud service providers) eyes.
•	It is easy to hack our complete data during transmission trough a single source.

SOLUTION
•	By applying stegnography, encryption and compression technique over the splitted data at local host we resolve the problem of untrustworthy CSP.
•	By using splitting of data over the splitted server we can save over data completely from hacking

TECH. Innovation ASSOCIATE 
•	The idea of using of splitting algorithms on data and sending or receiving of that spltted data through on different service.

INTECTUAL PROPERTY
•	Data splitting algorithm with extension type hiding.
CURRENT MARKET TRED
•	Currently we did not have a single platform on which we can apply encryption compression and stenography at local host itself with splitting of data in several parts and our system do provide.
